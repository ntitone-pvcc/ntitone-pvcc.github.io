   <h1>Planned Obsolescence and the Right to Repair</h1> 

    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    
    <p>
        Planned obsolescence, which involves the design and marketing of products with a deliberately limited lifespan in order to stimulate sales, can be found across almost 
        every category of consumer goods. It is especially prevalent in the consumer electronics industry where, for example, phone manufacturers will 
        release a new product and almost immediately begin hyping up the next iteration. Quite often these new models lack significant changes, offer 
        little to no access to materials that allow for third-party repairability, and are designed in such a way that they are not upgradable after 
        purchase. This creates a closed ecosystem in which the consumer is dependent on the manufacturer for product support, which in turn stifles small 
        businesses. It also creates a throw-away mindset which contributes to the increasing amount of electronic waste. Additionally, this constant 
        turnover only adds to the socio-economic disadvantages experienced by low-income families.
    </p>

    <h2>Waste Concerns</h2>

    <p>
        E-waste, which refers to discarded electronic equipment and its components, is considered "the fastest growing solid waste stream in the world" 
        [<a href="sources.html#6">6</a>]. It contains a variety of toxic chemicals, including lead and mercury, posing health risks to those working in the waste management industry 
        and to individuals living in areas where soil contamination can leach into the groundwater supply due to improper disposal. This has prompted 
        agencies such as the NIH to recommend that manufacturers make a conscious effort to lengthen the life cycle of their products as part of their 
        proposed solutions [<a href="sources.html#4">4</a>]. While it is highly unlikely that manufacturers will be receptive to changing their marketing strategies, even small 
        concessions such as building in some amount of upgradability and making replacement parts more readily available would go a long way in reducing 
        waste.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Right to Repair</h2>

    <p>
        While some may argue that the speed at which technology is improving, especially within the realm of consumer electronics, is the main reason 
        the turnover rate of devices is so high, the business model employed by many major electronics manufacturers is certainly not helping. The basic 
        idea behind the right to repair is that consumers should have the ability to upgrade, modify, and repair the items that they have purchased without
        having to rely on the manufacturer for repair or replacement [<a href="sources.html#3">3</a>]. By limiting repair options to either direct through the manufacturer or 
        “authorized” repair centers, manufacturers have essentially created a monopoly over the maintenance and lifecycle of their products. As a result, 
        without suitable competition in the repair market, the cost of fixing an item quite often exceeds its value pushing the consumer to just replace 
        it instead. Furthermore, this puts communities without access to a localized repair center at a disadvantage, especially low-income areas for 
        which the added cost of shipping (if that is even an option) may prove to be too much. These restrictions also hurt local repair shops, which are 
        often more accessible and affordable than manufacturer authorized repair centers. These small businesses not only stimulate the local economy, 
        but also provide a source of jobs that help promote technical literacy within the community. Additionally, by not providing access to repair 
        manuals or diagnostic tools manufacturers also alienate the DIY community who tend to factor maintainability into their purchasing decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Equity and the Digital Divide</h2>

    <p>
        Low-income families are particularly disadvantaged by the constant need to replace electronic devices that could otherwise be repaired or upgraded. When products are 
        designed to have short lifespans and manufacturers restrict access to affordable repair options, it disproportionately affects those who cannot afford to buy new items 
        frequently. This not only widens the digital divide but also limits access to technology, which is increasingly essential for education, employment, and daily life.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        Planned obsolescence is a long-standing marketing strategy that continues to impact consumers, the environment, and the economy. The right to repair movement is essential 
        for empowering consumers, nurturing small businesses, and reducing the overall amount of electronic waste generated each year. By advocating for policies that support 
        repair, upgrades, and access to resources, we can move toward a more sustainable society. Additionally, shifting focus away from planned obsolescence can help close the 
        digital divide, ensuring that technology remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status.
